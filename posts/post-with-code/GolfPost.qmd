Here's my first attempt to load golf rounds in to a Quarto blog. Mostly it's an excuse to journal further about my golf game.

```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(gt)
```

A few notes about the round:

```{r message = F}
## Round Notes
Course <- "Langston GC"
Round_DateTime <- as.POSIXct('2024-01-27 09:20:00 EST')
Tees <- "White"       # The longest available for the day.
Slope     <- 115      # Generally a pretty easy slope, but conditions made it play worse
Rating    <- 68.6     # Also a generally easy rating
PC_coeff  <- 3        # Unofficial. The course was in shocking condition after the snow-melt.



#Loading in the scorecard:
scorecard <- read_csv('scorecard_20240127_langston.csv') |>
  clean_names()

Adjusted_Par <- round(18.3 * Slope/113 + Rating) + PC_coeff
Course_Handicap <- Adjusted_Par - sum(scorecard$par)
```

```{r}
