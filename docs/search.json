    "text": "New Year, New Me More Sustainable Goals\nJanuary is a natural goal-setting month. Like most people, I initially rushed to improve what I saw were the worst parts of myself.\nThen I reread that last sentence. Then I was sad.\nI once thought that the quickest way to self-improvement comes was a counterweight of self-loathing urgency. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs terribly uncommon. For me, it tends to sound like:\n\n‚Äú[Insert Unattainable Habit to Adopt] needs to happen IMMEDIATELY because everything is so awful!!!!!‚Äù\n\nIt works, but it is also absolutely exhausting: I‚Äôve seen plenty of front-end improvement only to burn out easily and often.\nThrough this experience, I am beginning to learn that slow progress is lasting progress. More specifically, progress for me will require patiently re-framing my scarcity mindset, including:\n\naccepting how far I‚Äôve come (I‚Äôm not starting from scratch. Everything is not awful.)\ncelebrating my growth and learning from my mistakes (In fact, everything is pretty good! I‚Äôve accomplished a ton, including many mistakes.)\ntrusting myself to stay present and keep executing, leave the future for the future. (The opportunities I‚Äôm chasing will present themselves often. I trust myself to be as present as possible when they arrive.).\n\nSneaky re-frame: Mistakes are progress!So this year, I‚Äôm not throwing out the old me. I‚Äôm staying present with the current version of myself, and building toward the following milestones:\n\nRebuild Back to Full Strength, Physically and Financially\nMy knee injury from lifting was just judged not to need an MRI (yay!). More great news is that I‚Äôve kept off the 20 pounds I lost last year during the recovery process. Looking for more, but staying patient and staying strong.\n\nFinancially I‚Äôm riding through some turbulence thanks to some early-year emergencies, but we‚Äôre getting back on track after an eventful 2023.\nKeep Building Upon Healthier Habits, and Fail Often\nNamely, I‚Äôm keeping my spaces clean and relatively uncluttered. We‚Äôre starting there and building out. I‚Äôm also developing the habit of writing every day, which leads to‚Ä¶\nGet That Portfolio Up!\nThat‚Äôs the point of this website. I‚Äôve been sitting on serious soccer analysis for years, but I‚Äôve struggled to keep the ideas in my head because life is busy. Dedicating more time to documenting my process will be important and helpful. We‚Äôll see how it goes!"

Current candidates are as follows, suggestions welcome:Find me on social media and feel free to DM course suggestions!\nCharleston, SC - Kiawah Island is a must for any golfer, and a Charleston Battery match seems like a must for any soccer historian.\nRaleigh, NC - Tobacco Road is a must and I have to see if the NC Courage are a bigger draw than NCFC.\nLouisville, KY - Renting hickory clubs and traveling back in time, then heading to a Lou City or Racing Louisville match. By the way, Racing Louisville‚Äôs houndstooth kit is absolute üî•üî•üî•.\nAtlanta, GA - The soccer nerd vibes at a packed ATL United Game have been on the list since I saw the Footie Mob for the first time. Course suggestions are welcome.\n\n\nCurrent Mood: üòñ‚ñ∂Ô∏èüôÉ\nAnnoyed, but confident. I‚Äôve been dealing with some early-year emergencies lately (nothing I‚Äôll get into here). However, I‚Äôm pretty proud of my response so far. Upon reflection, I want to be able to handle my stress while being able to function clearly. And if I can‚Äôt, I want to be able to confront what or who is bothering me head-on, while remaining composed and affable.\nTrying to be patient as possible: the problems remain stubborn and will likely stay problems for the next few months.\nThere will always be problems. I can control what I can control, and I can control my response to the things I can‚Äôt control."
